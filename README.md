# flashpca

flashpca performs fast principal component analysis (PCA) of single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data, similar to smartpca from EIGENSOFT
(http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/) and shellfish
(https://github.com/dandavison/shellfish). flashpca is based on the randomized
PCA algorithm (Alg. 3) of Halko et al. 2011 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5510).

Main features:

* Fast: PCA of 15,000 individuals over 43,000 SNPs in &lt;10 min
 (multi-threaded)
* Natively reads PLINK bed/bim/fam files
* Easy to use
* Experimental: kernel PCA

## Download statically linked version

Note: we recommend compiling from source for best performance.

See [Releases](https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca/tags) for statically-linked version for Linux x86-64 &ge; 2.6.15

### System requirements
* 64-bit linux
* For large datasets you'll need large amounts of RAM, e.g. for 15,000
   individuals (43K SNPs) you'll need about 14GB RAM, for 150,000 individuals
   (43K SNPs) you'll need about 145GB RAM (estimated using
   https://github.com/jhclark/memusg)
   (we are working on a version which will use less RAM).

## Building from source

To get the latest version:
   ```
   git clone git://github.com/gabraham/flashpca
   ```

### Requirements

On Linux:

* 64-bit OS
* g++ compiler
* Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), v3.2 or higher
   (if you get a compile error ``error: no match for 'operator/' in '1 / ((Eigen::MatrixBase...`` you'll need a more recent Eigen)
* Boost (http://www.boost.org/), specifically boost_system/boost_system-mt,
   boost_iostreams/boost_iostreams-mt,
   boost_filesystem/boost_filesystem-mt,
   boost_program_options/boost_program_options-mt.
* libgomp for openmp support
* Recommended: plink2 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) for SNP
   thinning

On Mac:

* Homebrew (http://brew.sh) to install gcc/g++ and boost
* Eigen, as above
* Set CXX to whatever g++ version you're using before calling make, e.g.:
```
export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.7
```

### To install

Edit the [Makefile](Makefile) to reflect where you have installed the Eigen
headers and Boost headers and libraries:
   ```
   EIGEN_INC=/usr/local/include/eigen
   BOOST_INC=/usr/local/include/boost
   BOOST_LIB=/usr/local/lib
   ```
Run make:
   ```
   cd flashpca
   make all
   ```
Note: the compilation process will first look for a local directory named
Eigen. It should contain the file signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library. Next,
it will look for the directory /usr/include/eigen3 (Debian/Ubuntu location
for Eigen), although those available through apt-get tend to be older versions.

## Quick start

First thin the data by LD (highly recommend
[plink2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) for this):
   ```
   plink --bfile data --indep-pairwise 1000 50 0.05 --exclude range exclusion_regions.txt
   plink --bfile data --extract plink.prune.in --make-bed --out data_pruned
   ```
where [exclusion_regions.txt](exclusion_regions.txt) contains:
   ```
   5 44000000 51500000 r1
   6 25000000 33500000 r2
   8 8000000 12000000 r3
   11 45000000 57000000 r4
   ```
(You may need to change the --indep-pairwise parameters to get a suitable
number of SNPs for you dataset, 10,000-50,000 is usually enough.)

To run on the pruned dataset:
   ```
   ./flashpca --bfile data_pruned
   ```

We highly recommend using multi-threading, to run in multi-threaded mode with 8 threads:
   ```
   ./flashpca --bfile data_pruned --numthreads 8
   ```

Eigensoft-scaling of genotypes (default):
   ```
   ./flashpca --stand binom ...
   ```

To use genotype centering (compatible with R prcomp):
   ```
   ./flashpca --stand center ...
   ```

For more options:
   ```
   ./flashpca --help
   ```

## Output

flashpca produces the following files:

* `eigenvectors.txt`: the top k eigenvectors of the covariance
   X X^T / (n - 1), same as matrix U from the SVD of the genotype matrix
   X=UDV^T.
* `pcs.txt`: the top k principal components (the projection of the data on the
eigenvectors, scaled by the eigenvalues,  same as XV (or UD). This is the file
you will want to plot the PCA plot from.
* `eigenvalues.txt`: the top k eigenvalues of X X^T / (n - 1). These are the
    square of the singular values D (square of sdev from prcomp).
* `pve.txt`: the proportion of total variance explained by *each of the top k*
   eigenvectors (the total variance is given by the trace of the covariance
   matrix X X^T / (n - 1), which is the same as the sum of all eigenvalues).
   To get the cumulative variance explained, simply
   do the cumulative sum of the variances (`cumsum` in R).

## Warning:

You must perform quality control using PLINK (at least filter --geno, --mind,
--maf, --hwe) before running flashpca on your data. You will likely get
spurious results otherwise.

## Experimental features

* flashpca now experimentally supports low-rank [**kernel
PCA**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_principal_component_analysis) using an RBF
(Gaussian) kernel K(x, x') = exp(-||x - x'||_2^2 / sigma^2) (specify using `--kernel
rbf`).
* The kernel is double-centred.
* The default kernel parameter sigma is the median of the pairwise Euclidean distances of a random subset
   of samples (controlled by `--rbfsample`, default=min(1000, n)), and can also
   be specified using `--sigma`.
* The rest of the options are the same as for standard PCA.
* Currently, the proportion of variation explained is not computed for kPCA.

## Calling flashpca from R

flashpca is now available as an independent R package.

After cloning the git archive, install the package `flashpcaR`:
   ```
   R CMD INSTALL flashpcaR
   ```

Example usage, assuming `X` is a sample by SNP matrix in dosage
coding (0, 1, 2):
   ```
   library(flashpcaR)
   r <- flashpca(X, do_loadings=TRUE, verbose=TRUE, stand="binom", ndim=10)
   ```

Output:
   * `values`: eigenvalues
   * `vectors`: eigenvectors
   * `projection`: projection of sample onto eigenvectors (X V)
   * `loadings`: SNP loadings, if using a linear kernel
